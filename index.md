# About Me

Hi, I am Asad! I am a post-doctoral research fellow at the Dept. of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence under the [Faculty of Information Technology](https://www.monash.edu/fit/) in [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/). My research interests include _pollination monitoring_, _conservation technology_, and _AI for environmental monitoring_.

I completed my **PhD** in **Information Technology** from **Monash University** in **2025** with a specialisation in **Artificial Intelligence**, under the guidance of [Prof. Alan Dorin](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/alan-dorin) and [Dr. Vanessa Kellermann](https://scholars.latrobe.edu.au/v2kellermann). My PhD research was on developing AI technologies for monitoring Australian native bees. I have a strong background in computer vision, machine learning, and data science. I have published several research papers in top-tier conferences and journals.

I am passionate about leveraging technology to address real-world challenges. I am particularly interested in developing AI technologies for environmental monitoring and conservation. I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate on projects that have a positive impact on society. If you are interested in collaborating with me, feel free to reach out to me.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, hiking, and photography. I am also a big fan of cricket. I am always up for a chat, so feel free to reach out to me if you want to discuss anything related to AI, conservation, or just want to have a chat.
